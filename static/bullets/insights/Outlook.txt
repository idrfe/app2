Annual GDP growth likely weakened further in Q1. Higher inflation and
interest rates will have knocked private spending, as suggested by lower
consumer sentiment in the quarter. Economic activity grew at a faster rate
in January, but our panelists anticipate a slowdown in February–March.
In other news, in March the president suffered his first major defeat in
Congress; a bill to reform the political system was withdrawn following
opposition within the ruling coalition. The defeat suggests that a bill to
reform pensions may face similar obstacles. The pension reform was
submitted to Congress in mid-March and would require workers earning
up to three times the minimum wage (around USD 730) per month to
pay into the public system. To avoid disrupting local asset markets, the
government has proposed setting up a bond-buying savings fund. Exact
details remain vague, which has unsettled some investors.
