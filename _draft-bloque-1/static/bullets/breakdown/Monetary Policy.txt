At its 30 March meeting, the board of directors of Colombia’s Central Bank
(BanRep) unanimously agreed to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25
basis points, from 12.75% to 13.00%, matching our panelists’ expectations. The
move marked the 13th consecutive rate hike and amounted to a cumulative
1,125 basis points of increases since the current tightening cycle began in
September 2021.
Core inflation continued to rise in March, and headline inflation was stable at the
highest rate since 1999. This pushed BanRep to hike rates to ensure inflation
converges to target in the medium run.
That said, the smaller size of the hike reflected two facts: Inflation expectations
for the year ahead fell to 7.2% in March from January’s 7.7% in BanRep’s latest
survey, and concern has grown regarding the impact of recent rate hikes on
economic activity.
In its press release, BanRep avoided giving explicit forward guidance, saying
that future decisions will depend on the information that becomes available.
Nonetheless, given the slowing economy and the recent deceleration of inflation
expectations, most of our panelists believe that the Bank has reached the end
of its hiking cycle. Our panelists expect BanRep to begin lowering rates from
Q3 onward.
The next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for 28 April.
Analysts at Scotiabank Colpatria commented on the outlook:
“Given previous results, […] we think the board could opt for a pause in April if
CPI inflation is aligned with expectations, if we have an upward surprise it opens
the door to another 25 bps hike.”
Meanwhile, analysts at Credicorp Capital said:
“We expect stability in the next monetary policy meeting but do not rule out an
additional adjustment (25 bps) depending on the evolution of inflation in the
coming months. We are maintaining our estimate for the policy rate of 9% at the
end of the year.”
Panelists see the policy rate ending 2023 at 10.97% and 2024 at 6.83%.
