The S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 51.5
in March from February’s 49.8. Consequently, the index rose above the 50.0
no-change mark for the first time in three months, signaling an improvement in
manufacturing sector operating conditions from the previous month.
The manufacturing PMI rose as output, new orders and employment rose. The
improvement was driven by reduced supply bottlenecks. Less positively, input
and output inflation quickened compared to the prior month. Nonetheless, the
business panorama appeared to remain bright ahead, with firms’ sentiment
rising to a seven-month high on hopes of stronger demand in the next year.
Andrés Langebaek Rueda, Chief Economist Bolivar Group at Davivienda, said:
“It is good news that the March PMI is back above the 50-point threshold as are
output, orders and employment. However, the average of the indicators in the
first quarter of the year suggests weak growth in industrial activity. More hopeful
is the expectation of production in the next twelve months.”
