On 30 March, the Central Bank (BanRep) delivered its 13th consecutive
rate hike—a 25 basis point increase—bringing the benchmark interest
rate to 13.00%, the highest since 1999. Most of our panelists think that the
Bank has now finished its tightening cycle and will begin lowering rates
by the end of 2023. The panel forecasts the policy rate to end 2023 at
10.97% and 2024 at 6.83%.
