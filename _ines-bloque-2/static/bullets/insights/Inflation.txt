Inflation was steady again at 13.3% in March—the highest print since
March 1999. Inflation should decline in 2023 as domestic demand and
commodity prices cool. However, inflation is seen staying well above the
Central Bank’s 2.0–4.0% target even at the end of 2023. Key factors to
watch include fiscal stimulus and the strength of the peso. Our panel sees
inflation averaging 11.0% in 2023, which is up 0.7 percentage points from
last month’s forecast, and 5.5% in 2024.
